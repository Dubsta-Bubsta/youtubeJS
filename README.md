# youtubeJS - working with [Youtube Api v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)

Created in October 2019

# About
Like the last project, this one was made on video from YouTube channel Glo academy. Layout and styles I also took from the author. The JS code was implemented by the author and I repeated and understood it. The main reason I started doing this project is using API, specifically Youtube API.  
I created API Key Clinet ID. Connected API to my project and started working with it. (Video author shown this).  
But, in project were a lot of little issues that I fixed. Unfortunately, i didn't fix main problem - another people, who trying open my website can't open their likes and subscriptions.
# Result
As a result, I worked with Youtube API and made more convenient modules system for Webpack
