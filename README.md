# youtubeJS - working with [Youtube Api v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/)

Created in October 2019

# About
Like the last project, this one was made on video from YouTube channel Glo academy. Layout and styles I also took from the author. The JS code was implemented by the author and I repeated and understood it. The main reason I started doing this project is using API, specifically Youtube API.  
I created API Key Clinet ID. Connected API to my project and started working with it. (Video author shown this).  
But, in project were a lot of little issues that I fixed. Unfortunately, i didn't fix main problem - another people, who trying open my website can't open their likes and subscriptions.

# How to be authorized?
To be authorized you need to use your Youtube account. When you press "Log in", auth form will be opened. There is no reason to worry about your account, because this website using Youtube API.
As a result, I got a good experience with bash, NPM connection and webpack initial stage
